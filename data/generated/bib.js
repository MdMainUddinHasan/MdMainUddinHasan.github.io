        "abstract": "For the past few years, huge interest and dramatic development have been shown for the Internet of Things (IoT) based constrained Wireless sensor network (WSN) to achieve efficient resource utilization and better service delivery. IoT requires a better communication network for data transmission between heterogeneous devices and an optimally deployed energy-efficient WSN. The clustering technique applied for WSN node deployment needs to be efficient; therefore, the entire architecture can obtain a better network lifetime. While clustering, the entire network is partitioned into various clusters. Moreover, the cluster head (CH) selection process also needs proper attention for achieving efficient data communication towards the sink node via selected CH and also for increasing the node reachability within the cluster. In this proposed framework, an energy efficient deep belief network (DBN) based routing protocol is developed, which achieves better data transmission through the selected path. Due to this the packet delivery ratio (PDR) gets improved. In this framework, initially, the nodes in the whole network is grouped as clusters using a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm, which assigns a reward for the nodes that belong to the particular cluster. Then, the CH required for efficient data communication is selected using a Mantaray Foraging Optimization (MRFO) algorithm. The data is transmitted to the sink node via the selected CH using an efficient deep learning approach. At last, the performance of proposed deep network based routing protocol is evaluated using different evaluation metrics they are network lifetime, energy consumption, number of alive nodes, and packet delivery rate. Finally, the evaluated results are compared with few existing algorithms. Among all these algorithms, the proposed DBN routing protocol has achieved better network lifetime.",

        "abstract": "Delay-/disruption-tolerant networking (DTN) is developed for reliable data delivery in challenging communication environments characterized by a very long propagation delay and/or lengthy, random link disruption and highly lossy data links. Space-based networks and deep-space communication scenarios are typical of this type of communication environment. Bundle protocol (BP) and Licklider transmission protocol (LTP) were developed as the main protocols of DTN for reliable data transmission in space. Some studies have been done in evaluating the transmission performance, mainly throughput/goodput, on the use of BP/LTP for reliable file delivery in deep-space communication scenarios. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has also demonstrated DTN and implemented the use of its BP protocol on the International Space Station (ISS) for data delivery to the earth ground station. However, a little work has been done in analyzing the performance of BP/LTP for reliable data/file delivery from the ISS to the ground stations, especially in presence of link disruption. In this paper, analytical modeling and the numerical evaluation results are presented to study the effect of link disruptions on the use of BP/LTP for reliable file delivery over a relay-based communication architecture between the ISS and the ground stations.",

        "abstract": "Delay/Disruption Tolerant Network (DTN) is playing an important role in the future space communications, especially the deep space communications. The available energy resources on the spacecraft are very limited and sometimes may become very scarce. In such conditions, the extra transmission effort is required as small as possible, to achieve the goal of saving energy resources. Current studies indicate that the packet sizes of DTN protocol layers such as bundle size, LTP block size, and Licklider Transmission Protocol (LTP) segment size have an impact on the extra transmission effort, but the studies are lack of theoretical model and analysis. Therefore, a theoretical model of extra transmission effort is proposed in terms of BP/LTP protocol stack, which can be applied to DTNs using other convergence layer protocol besides LTP. What's more, an analysis is made to the theoretical model and a scheme of saving the energy resources by optimizing the packet sizes of DTN protocol layers is presented. The numerical evaluation results show that this scheme can effectively conserve the energy consumption of the spacecraft, which can be a good solution to the scarcity of energy resources in space missions.",

        "abstract": "A reasonable parameter configuration helps improve the data transmission performance of the Licklider Transmission Protocol (LTP). Previous research has focused mainly on parameter optimization for LTP in simplified scenarios with one to two hops or multihop scenarios with a custody mechanism of the Bundle Protocol (BP). However, the research results are not applicable to communications in Complex Deep Space Networks (CDSNs) without the custody mechanism of BP that are more suitable for deep space communications with LTP. In this paper, we propose a model of file delivery time for LTP in CDSNs. Based on the model, we propose a Parameter Optimization Design Algorithm for LTP (LTP-PODA) of configuring reasonable parameters for LTP. The results show that the accuracy of the proposed model is at least 6.47% higher than that of the previously established models based on simple scenarios, and the proposed model is more suitable for CDSNs. Moreover, the LTP parameters are optimized by the LTP-PODA algorithm to obtain an optimization plan. Configuring the optimization plan for LTP improves the protocol transmission performance by at least 18.77% compared with configuring the other parameter configuration plans.",

        "abstract": "Wireless Sensor Networks include a substantial number of nodes with limited battery power that is used for gathering and sending the data to the Base station. Here most energy is consumed in data transfer. Hence a foremost problem is the maximization of network lifetime through minimization of energy consumption in the nodes. To resolve this issue, the clustering method is involved to achieve energy-efficient data transmission. A cluster head is elected which uses an energy distribution mechanism to conserve the remaining power, thereby extending network lifetime. Various present methodologies are employed but every algorithm had notable constraints individually. In this paper, a hybrid Sparrow Search Algorithm with Differential Evolution algorithm is intended to solve the energy efficiency issue by cluster head selection in Wireless Sensor Networks. The proposed algorithm uses the high-level search efficiency of the Sparrow Search Algorithm and the lively potential of Differential Evolution that enhances the lifetime of nodes. The performance of this hybrid model seems to be exploiting the count of alive nodes and dead nodes, throughput, and residual energy. The proposed Improved Sparrow search algorithm using the Differential evolution model for choosing the best possible cluster head shows a development in residual power and throughput than other compared algorithms.",

However, no much work has been done to fully evaluate the performance of DTN in such an environment, especially in the presence of long link disruption, data corruption and loss, and link asymmetry. In this paper, we present an experimental performance evaluation of DTN architecture and protocol stack, with Licklider transmission protocol (LTP) serving as a convergence layer adapter (CLA) underneath bundle protocol (BP), in a typical LEO-satellite communication infrastructure accompanied by a very long link outage, various packet corruption and loss rates, and channel rate symmetry and asymmetry.

An analytical framework is developed for the effect of multiple random link disruptions on LTP's reliable data delivery in deep-space networks. The study indicates that the models accurately predict the transmission performance of LTP over a deep-space communication channel in presence of multiple link disruptions.
